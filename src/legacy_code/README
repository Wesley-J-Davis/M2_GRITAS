  NOTE:  Get all the needed "diag_conv_anl, diag_conv_ges and all the ods" from
  /home/dao_ops/ExpID/run/.../archive/obs/Yyyyy/Mmm/Ddd/Hhh
  for the requred year and month.

     run_get_obs.csh      (The script the retrieve the required files from archive. Modify for the required dates.
                            If there is no need to dmget  the files, comment the dmget line in the script, )
                            

  The following scritps to be used to process Conventional an d Satellite gridded (GrITAS) data.
   
   (Modifiy the scripts to represent the appropriate experiment, workiding and storage directories.)
 
     (slurm runs)
     run_sat_gritas_merra2.j
     run_conv_gritas_merra2.j

     -------------------------------------------------------
     To  generate DAAC needed  single file for SAT:

      generate_daac_gritas_files.csh (needed file run_merra2_ncrcat.csh)

     -------------------------------------------------------
     To  generate DAAC needed  single file for CONV monthly:

     generate_daac_conv_gritas_files.csh (needed file  run_merra2_conv_ncrcat.csh )

     -------------------------------------------------------
     To  generate DAAC needed  single file for CONV hourly:

     generate_daac_conv_hourly_gritas_files.csh ( needed files run_merra2_conv_hourly_ncrcat.csh merra2_conv_hourly_ncrcat.csh )

MERRA

The following executables are assumed to be in the directory when running scripts: GFIO_mean_r8.x gritas.x
  
ctl_file: directory containing the control files
rc_files: directory containing the resource files
old_files: directory containing
set_job: The main script for generating the statistics from conventional
         data.  Calls the script, diag2gritas2.csh
set_dsat_job.csh: The main script for generating the statistics from
                  satellite data. Calls the script run_dsat.csh
run_dsat.csh: Script for migrating archived input files and calling the
              script, dsat2gritas2.csh or dsat2gritas2_ods.csh
diag2gritas2.csh: Script for doing most of the processing of conventional
                  data including executing the gritas.x program (to generate
                  the 6-hourly files), compressing the data files and 
                  transfering the data files to the portal directory and 
                  calling the script gritas2means.csh (to compute the
                  monthly statistics)
dsat2gritas2.csh: Script for doing most of the processing of satellite
                  data including executing the gritas.x program (to generate
                  the monthly means), compressing the data files, and 
                  copying the data to the portal directory.
name_archfiles.csh: Script used to name input archived files. Called by
                    diag2gritas2.csh and run_dsat.csh
